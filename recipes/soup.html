        <h2>Miso Soup</h2>
        <p><em>A feature of most Japanese meals, miso soup always contains miso and dashi, a stock made with kombu seaweed and bonito flakes. Though various ingredients can be added, this tofu and scallion version is quite commonâ€”and often served at Japanese restaurants in America.</em></p>
        <h3>Ingredient</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 to 5 cups dashi, recipe follows</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown miso paste, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white miso paste, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>6 ounces firm tofu, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
            <li>2 scallions, white and green, thinly sliced on the diagonal</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons aji mirin (sweetened rice wine), optional</li>
        </ul>        
        <h5>Dashi</h5>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a saucepan heat the dashi and whisk in the miso pastes. Bring to a simmer and add the tofu, scallions, and mirin, if using. Remove from the heat and serve immediately.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan, combine the water and kombu. Bring to a simmer, uncovered, over medium heat. Remove the kombu and discard.
